# Introduction

## What is it?

A discord server for managing fantasy / auction leagues with friends

## Who is it intended for?

Friends, friends of friends, acquaintances who are participating in fantasy leagues

## What problem does the software solve?

- Integrates chatting about the game / tournament with actual management of the fantasy
- Automatically manages the game through commands vs manually having to do transfers/trades etc
- Customizable - lets us make trades for 1 game, 2 games etc, make captains and other completely customizable things
- Because it's automated / manged, it completely eliminates human error and cheating (if any)
- Inclusive - can have people in the chat just talking without running commands for the fantasy league
- Accessible - people are familiar with discord already and not introducing anything radical or new
- Extendible - with new discord features, or adding on new leagues, or adding multiple simultaneous leagues if needed
